# Hey guys ðŸ‘‹, I'm Brayan Bernardo!

Redefining what is possible with conversational **AI personas** (aka **photorealistic avatars**).

I'm a curious software engineer with a background in **Machine Learning Research**, **Full Stack Web Development**, and **Quality Assurance**. With a strong foundation in both software development and artificial intelligence, I have progressed through various technical roles, contributing to projects in the tech industry and academy

Currently working as a **Machine Learning Researcher** at [H.IAAC](https://hiaac.unicamp.br/) , where I work with **Generative AI** models, synthesizing realistic and expressive virtual avatars driven by speech and text inputs. I'm also recently finished my master's degree on the same topic at Recod.ai @ Unicamp ([#5 LatAm](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/universidade-estadual-de-campinas-unicamp)).

-  **PyTorch**, **Docker**  
-  **Transformer/Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Variational Autoencoder (VAEs)**.
